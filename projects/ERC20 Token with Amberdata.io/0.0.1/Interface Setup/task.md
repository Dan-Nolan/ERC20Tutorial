## Interfaces

In this last stage we are going to set up the ERC20 Interface per the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specification.

There are quite a few lines of code in the stage, however, all of the functions that you need to implement are clearly documented in the above link.

Tasks to complete:

1. Declare a [Solidity Pragma 0.5.0](?tab=details&scroll=Solidity%20Pragma)
2. Declare the `ERC20Interface` interface
2. Declare the 6 `external` functions per the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specifications
3. Declare the 2 events per the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specifications
