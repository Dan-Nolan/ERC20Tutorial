## Solidity Stage Details

TODO: Let people know that they need to do a "token sale"
Explain usually you'll accept ether for the tokens but in this
case we will just give it out for free

Because right now only the contract creator has the tokens and that's not really useful 

Here you can write details describing this stage with links to the [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/installing-solidity.html).

Be sure that the solidity documentation version matches the stage version!
