## Solidity Task

For this stage we're going to create a couple of mappings (more info in [Details tab](?tab=details&scroll=Solidity%20Mappings)). 

These mappings will allow us to do two things:
- record the number of ERC20 tokens that the user posseses, in other words the account balance
- record how much an account is allowed to spend on behalf of another account

Tasks to complete:

1. Declare a `public` mapping, `address -> uint256`, named `balances`
